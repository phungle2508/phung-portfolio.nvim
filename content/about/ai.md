I’m Le Dinh Phung, a full-stack-oriented backend engineer with a strong foundation in Java (Spring Boot) and frontend development using Next.js. My focus lies in designing scalable microservice and microfrontend architectures powered by technologies like JHipster, Kafka, Redis, and Docker. I’ve built production-grade systems integrating OAuth2, Keycloak, and Jenkins CI/CD pipelines, and deployed them using Nginx, Liquibase, and AWS services. Whether it’s syncing microservices or optimizing APIs, I thrive at the intersection of backend architecture and DevOps excellence.
