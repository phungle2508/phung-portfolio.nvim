Hi, I’m Le Dinh Phung — a passionate backend developer specializing in Java (Spring Boot) and modern web stacks like Next.js. I love solving architectural problems with microservices, micro frontends, and cloud-native tools like Docker, Jenkins, and AWS. My work spans from building secure authentication systems with OAuth2 and Keycloak to managing CI/CD pipelines, Kafka messaging, and scalable deployments. My goal is to build efficient, resilient systems for real-world users.
